# CCDLibrary
Arduino library for interfacing Chrysler's legacy CCD-bus using the CCDBusTransceiver development board.

This library is compatible with the CDP68HC68S1 CCD-bus transceiver IC and the ChryslerCCDSCIScanner hardware.
In this case you need to uncomment this line in the examples:
```
#define ChryslerCCDSCIScanner
```

Arduino Mega / ATmega2560 microcontroller is required!
